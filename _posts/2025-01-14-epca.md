Exponential family principal component analysis (EPCA) outperforms traditional PCA on data binary, count, and compositional data (i.e., whenever data is from the exponential family and not simply Gaussian). ExpFamilyPCA.jl is the first package for EPCA in Julia and the first in any language to support EPCA for most common exponential family distributions.
