Standard exploration methods typically rely on random coverage of the state space or coverage-promoting exploration bonuses. However, in partially observed settings, the biggest exploration challenge is often posed by the need to discover information-gathering strategies -- e.g., an agent that has to navigate to a location in traffic might learn to first check traffic conditions and then choose a route. In this work, we design a POMDP agent that gathers information about the hidden state, using ideas from the meta-exploration literature.
