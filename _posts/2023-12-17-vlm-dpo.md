Contrastive preference learning (CPL) is an extension of direct preference optimization (DPO) for arbitrary MDPs that has achieved promising results at small scales. Our project shows that CPL scales elegantly to high-dimensional, multimodal architectures and provides a simple, efficient method for aligning and steering autonomous agents.
