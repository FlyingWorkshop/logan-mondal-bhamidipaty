Belief compression is a technique for planning in large environments with state and outcome uncertainty. CompressedBeliefMDPs.jl, part of the popular POMDPs.jl community, provides a general framework for applying belief compression in large POMDPs and offers a suite of algorithms for sampling, compressing, and solving.
