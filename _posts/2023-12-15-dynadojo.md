DynaDojo is a novel benchmarking platform designed for data-driven dynamical system identification. DynaDojo provides diagnostics on three ways an algorithm’s performance scales: across the number of training samples, across the complexity of a dynamical system, and across resources needed to maintain a target error. Furthermore, DynaDojo enables studying out-of-distribution generalization (by providing unique test conditions for each system) and active learning (by supporting closed-loop control).
