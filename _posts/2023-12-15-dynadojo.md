DynaDojo is a novel Python platform for developing and benchmarking data-driven dynamical systems identification algorithms. It prioritizes resource-efficient parallelization strategies for running on clusters and provides 7 baseline algorithms, 20 dynamical systems, and 3 benchmarking challenges off the shelf, with users easily able to add more.
